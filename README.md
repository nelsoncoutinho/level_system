# Basic Level System 

I created this system so I could use it on my server, but as it's basic I decided to make it available to the public as well. 

The player will start with level 0 and 0 respect. Every 1 hour the player will receive 1 respect (you can change this in config.lua) and when they reach their total respect, which in this case is level 0 and 10 respect, they will rise to level 1.
